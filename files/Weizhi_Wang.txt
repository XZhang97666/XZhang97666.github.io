D. student advised by Prof. Xifeng Yan in University of California Santa Barbara. Before that, I obtained my master and bachelor degree from Rutgers University and Xi'an Jiaotong University, respectively. Research Focus I am focusing on the field of natural language processing. My research focus and past experience can be summarized as the following aspects: Multimodal Pre - trained Language Models: visually - augmented PLMs, multimodal commonsense reasoning with PLMs Multilingual and Multimodal Translation: zero - shot/few - shot translation in large - scale multilingual translation systems; end - to - end speech - to - text translation. Dialogue Systems: knowledge - enhanced dialogue systems with pre - trained models.

The proposed model deploys a tree - structured classification architecture, with every non - leaf tree node as a pre - trained BERT model. The proposed method can automatically transform fine - grained sentiment classification into hierarchical bi - classification or tri - classification tasks and complete the task through a decision tree structure. The experimental results demonstrate that proposed method improves the fine - grained classification performance of BERT - base baseline by 3.5%. Generative Hippocampal - entorhinal System [Code] We build up a generative model and inference network with VAE to intimidate the grid cells and place cells in Hippocampal - entorhinal System of human. Fast Weights [Code] I reimplemented the paper [Using Fast Weights to Attend to the Recent Past] using Py Torch. The other public available reimplementations for this paper are using Tensor Flow. The reimplemented accuracy of the information retrieval task in the source paper achieves 98%. Awesome NLP Models [Code] I reimplemented several classic NLP models using Py Torch, including HMM, Self - Attention, CRF, Log - Linear, Ngram.
